Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, all three models agreed. They all classified Dog_01.jpg as golden retriever 


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
ResNet:
Dog_01.jpg = golden retriever
Dog_01_flipped.jpg = irish setter, red setter (different)
AlexNet:
Dog_01.jpg = golden retriever
Dog_01_flipped.jpg = arabian camel (different, and not even a dog!)
VGG:
Dog_01.jpg = golden retriever
Dog_01_flipped.jpg = irish terrier (different)
none of the models classified them as the same breed. Each made mistakes with the flipped golden retriever image.

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes the Black_Bear_01.jpg and Car_01.jpg were classified by all 3 models as not dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
Overall, ResNet performed best. All three models classified Dog_01.jpg as a golden retriever, but ResNet at least recognized the flipped dog as a dog, unlike AlexNet (camel) and VGG (terrier).
Since it handled the flipped dog more reliably while also classifying the bear and car correctly, ResNet was the most consistent choice.
